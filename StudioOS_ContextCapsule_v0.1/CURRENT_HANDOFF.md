## Founder workflow

### Admin Founder (Experience Lab)

1. Open Experience Lab → **PROGRAM SELECTOR**
2. **BUILD STUDIO WORLD** → select canonical department (e.g. Experience Lab, CDS, Command Center) → review charter/plan → controlled batch with cost confirmation
3. **BUILD INDUSTRY PACKS** → select Industry Pack → department tree (HQ templates only)

### Normal Founder

- Creative Director Studio only — customize approved HQ; never enter Experience Lab
