# Memory — Conversation learnings and decisions

Append-only log. Each entry is from a user request to “add to motherboard.” Do not remove or edit existing entries.

## 2025-03-15 — Motherboard system created

Shared “core memory” for all agents: `motherboard/` holds project context and conversation learnings. Commands: **“load motherboard”** = read README → CORE → MEMORY and use as context; **“add to motherboard”** = read ADDING.md and append one new entry to MEMORY (and optionally a small CORE update) without overwriting or duplicating.

- **Context:** User wanted a single place for design/logic/flows and a way for past/future chats to contribute without repeating themselves.
- **Changes:** Created `motherboard/README.md`, `CORE.md`, `ADDING.md`, `MEMORY.md`.
- **Conventions:** Agents should read motherboard when user says “load motherboard”; when user says “add to motherboard,” follow ADDING.md and append only.

## 2025-03-15 — Verifying sync-profile API + add-to-motherboard test

Added a doc for checking if `/api/admin/sync-profile` exists and is deployed; user then ran “add to motherboard” to confirm the prompt works. Verifying the API: (1) route file `api/admin/sync-profile.ts` in repo/deployed branch, (2) `VITE_API_BASE` set to Vercel app URL (or empty for same-origin), (3) `curl -X OPTIONS` or POST to the deployed URL (200/204 or 400 = exists; 404 = not deployed).

- **Context:** User wanted to know how to verify the sync endpoint exists and is reachable; then tested “add to motherboard.”
- **Changes:** Created `docs/VERIFY_SYNC_PROFILE_API.md`. One new MEMORY entry (this one).
- **Conventions:** None. Confirms “add to motherboard” is understood and executed without extra explanation.

## 2025-03-15 — Full conversation summary (this chat)

**Context:** User wanted the motherboard to work so that (1) saying "add to motherboard" once turns on **auto-add for the rest of that chat** (no need to repeat the command), and (2) every entry documents the **entire conversation** from inception to now—not just recent messages—so new agents have full context and accuracy.

**Topics covered (full chat):**
- How to verify `/api/admin/sync-profile` exists and is deployed; created `docs/VERIFY_SYNC_PROFILE_API.md` (repo file, VITE_API_BASE, curl/browser checks).
- User tested "add to motherboard" to confirm the prompt works.
- User asked for **auto and continuous** add so they do not have to keep saying it. Implemented: README, ADDING.md, and `.cursor/rules/motherboard.mdc` updated so "add to motherboard" = add one entry now + enable auto-add for this chat; agent adds at end of significant exchanges after that. "Stop adding to motherboard" turns it off.
- User asked whether we add ALL prior prompts or just recent; wanted entire chat documented for full context. Updated ADDING.md (Rule 4 Full conversation context, format with Topics covered / Decisions), README, and Cursor rule so every entry must summarize the whole conversation so far, not just the latest turn.
- User asked: with auto on and having said "add to motherboard" before, is the full extent of our conversation saved so new agents have full context? Answer: it was not yet; this entry is the full-conversation summary for this chat.

**Decisions / outcomes:** Auto-add on for rest of chat after first "add to motherboard." Every MEMORY entry must reflect entire conversation so far. New agents get CORE + MEMORY; MEMORY should include full-conversation summaries.

**Changes:** motherboard/README.md, motherboard/ADDING.md, .cursor/rules/motherboard.mdc, docs/VERIFY_SYNC_PROFILE_API.md. This MEMORY entry.

**Conventions:** When adding to motherboard (manual or auto-add), always summarize the whole conversation in this chat so far so the motherboard stays up to date and new agents have full context.
